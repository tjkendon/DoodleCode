# An Arabesque of My Own

Fun messing around with colours, pattern and shape. Based a little on the mac screen saver.

Currently has some basic processing sketches to get an idea of where I can go and what I can do.

Arabesque_Demo includes some basic structure around generating colour patterns moving across circles.
