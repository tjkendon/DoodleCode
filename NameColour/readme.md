# Name Colour Generator

A simple generator to produce a consistant colour based on a given string, presumed to be a name. Probably implemented in dozens of things, but I noticed Mircosoft generating different colours for the same people depending on the application and thought it woudl be interesting to build something consistant. 

For now just generates a hex string for the colour.
