# Name Colour Generator

A simple generator to produce a consistant colour based on a given string, presumed to be a name. Probably implemented in dozens of things, but I noticed Mircosoft generating different colours for the same people depending on the application and thought it woudl be interesting to build something consistant. 

Version 1 has a tendency to jump long distances between colours for small changes. I've been working on Version 2 to try to make it more consistent based on some rules about the strings. For example percentage of vowels, "centre of mass" of vowels in a string and so forth.
