# Moving Agent

I always have to start again from scratch when I try to build simulated movement. This is a place to play and practice with moving things in 2d, mostly in processing and mostly based on the examples [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) [provides](https://processing.org/examples/accelerationwithvectors.html).

So far it includes a [basic velocity and acceleration](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/MovingAgent/BasicMotion) exmaple and a [vector / urges](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/MovingAgent/Mouse_Urge) example.
