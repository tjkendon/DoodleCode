# Season Length Calculator

Calculator to look at how long sporting seasons need to be to determine a proper sorting of the teams.

## Overview

The basic point of the Season Length Calculator is to take a look at how many games a comptition needs to really confirm that the result shows the "True Strength" of the teams compeating. This is another programatic attempt to make fun of sports announcers (see (https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/ListDifferenceFinder)[https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/ListDifferenceFinder]).
