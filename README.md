# DoodleCode
A collection of small programs for fun and demonstration purposes.

## Doodles in Development 
* [A*](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/AStar)
   * A sandbox for playing with A* pathfinding 
* [Colour Distance](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/ColourDistance)
   * Calculates the distance between two colours, and does some matching and possibly clustering for Perler purposes.
* [Competition Rank](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/CompetitionRank)
   * Space to play with quality of competition measures.  
* [EvoMandella](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/EvoMandala)
   * Playing with mandala shapes generated using genetic algorithm techniques.
* [Moving Agent](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/MovingAgent)
   * Experiments (and practice) making things move.
* [Pixel Counter](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/PixelCount)
   * Counts the pixels of each colour in and .png
* [Name Colour Generator](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/NameColour)
   * Generates a consistent colour based on a given string.   
* [PixelCount](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/PixelCount)
   * Counts the pixles in an image and organizes them by colour.
* [ProcessingChallenge](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/PixelCount)
   * A take on [Daniel Shiffman's](https://github.com/shiffman) [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) [Challenges](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges).
* [Simple Statistics](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/blob/main/SimpleStatistics/)
   * Calculates simple statistical measures from a sequence of numbers   
* Sleep Calculator
   * Determine when to go to bed or get up based on 90 minute sleep cycles.

## Complete Doodles
* [Category Vote](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/CategoryVote)
   * A survey which accumulates points to categories and then returns values from the top X categories, also good for a [Party List Proporition 
Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation) Electoral System 
* [Character Counter](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/CharacterCount)
   * Counts characters in a piece of text
* [Food-o-rac-o-cycle](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/Food-o-Rac-o-Cycle)
   * A breakfast picker - based on weights 
* [List Difference Finder](https://github.com/tjkendon/DoodleCode/tree/main/ListDifferenceFinder)
  * Finds the differences and similarity between
