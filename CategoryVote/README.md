# Category Vote

Inspiried mostly by the weird questions at the begining for Ogre Battle games (and other's I'm sure). Here a selection of questions will be asked, and the answers will accumulate points into various categories. Once "voting" is finished, categories are selected based on a system remenisant of [Party-list Proportional Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation), at least as I remember my Social Studies unit on Sweedish Political Systems from when I was 17.
