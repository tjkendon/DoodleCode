# List Difference Finder

Suppose you have two lists of names and you want to know how similar they are, or who's only one one, or who's on both. Well this the a tool to do that.

Mostly designed to allow me to imperically tell sports casters that none of the players on today's world cup squads also played in 1950, but also useful for other organization tasks.

Command line only at this point. Other versions forthcoming some day.
